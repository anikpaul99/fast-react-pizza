## Project Overview

The 'Fast React Pizza Co.' application was developed to provide a seamless experience for users to order pizzas from a dynamic menu, without the need for user accounts or login. The application allows users to add multiple pizzas to their cart, provide necessary delivery details, and place their order. Additionally, users have the option to mark their order as "priority" for an extra charge. This README file provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including its functionality, features, and setup instructions.

## Project Functionality

The application includes the following functionality:

- **Menu Loading:** The pizza menu is dynamically loaded from an API, allowing for easy updates to the menu items.
- **Order Placement:** Users can add pizzas to their cart and place an order by providing their name, phone number, and delivery address. GPS location can also be provided to assist with delivery.
- **Cart Management:** Users can view and manage the contents of their cart before placing an order.
- **Priority Orders:** Users can mark their order as a "priority" for an additional 20% of the cart price, even after the order has been placed.
- **Order Confirmation:** Each order is assigned a unique ID, which is displayed to the user for future reference.

## Features & Pages
